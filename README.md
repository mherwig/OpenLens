# OpenLens Windows Binary Build Repo

[![Build Lens](https://github.com/mherwig/OpenLens/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mherwig/OpenLens/actions/workflows/main.yml)

## How does it differ from github.com/MuhammedKalkan/OpenLens?
I created this repositoy mainly for myself and my team to have full control over the built binaries. Currently this repository only builds unsigned Windows binaries, which can be installed by using scoop.

##  Build Repo Only
This repository does **not** alter any source code of the OpenLens repository. Note, that the built binaries are currently **not signed**. For software issues regarding OpenLens or the Lens IDE, go to the [Lens repo](https://github.com/lensapp/lens/issues) and open an issue there.

## Extensions

Starting with 6.3.0 some extensions are removed from Lens. To install these most used extensions simply download the [openlens-node-pod-menu extension](https://github.com/mherwig/openlens-node-pod-menu/releases) and install the the extension by dragging the tarball into the extensions view of OpenLens (File -> extensions).

## Overview

This is the Binary Build Repo for the [Lens repository](https://github.com/lensapp/lens.git) aka **OpenLens**. This build only includes the open source part of the Lens IDE and does not require login. This repo was created due to lensapp/lens#5444.

Download and use as is. If you have trouble about not seeing pod logs, remove old config files / extensions remaining from old Lens app.

Auto Updater is now live starting with every binary downloaded with the `Latest` tag or the corresponding release assets.

### OpenLens vs Lens IDE
Paraphrasing from the [OpenLens README](https://github.com/lensapp/lens#readme)

#### OpenLens
The [OpenLens repository](https://github.com/lensapp/lens.git), is where Team Lens (Mirantis) develops the [Lens IDE](https://k8slens.dev/) product together with the community. It is backed by a number of Kubernetes and cloud native ecosystem pioneers. This source code is available to everyone under the [MIT license](https://github.com/lensapp/lens/blob/master/LICENSE).

#### Lens IDE
The Kubernetes management tool [Lens IDE](https://k8slens.dev/) is a distribution of the OpenLens repository with Team Lens specific customizations released under a traditional EULA.

## Installation
